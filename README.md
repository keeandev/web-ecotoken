ecoToken's previously open-sourced monorepo, with a reformed purpose to show the validity of my skills & abilties.
This version of our monorepo is quite old compared to the version I last worked with. The official repo sits at about 600+ commits, while this version sits at 300+ commits, to help you put the age of this repo into perspective.
